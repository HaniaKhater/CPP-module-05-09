# C++08 - Templated containers, iterators, algorithm

## Exercice 00: Easy find
The exercise requires writing a function template called "easyfind" that takes two parameters: a container of integers and an integer to be found. The function should find the first occurrence of the second parameter in the first parameter, and return an error value if no occurrence is found. The implementation should also include test cases.
## Exercise 01: Span
The exercise requires developing a Span class that can store a maximum of N integers and has member functions `addNumber()`, `shortestSpan()` and `longestSpan()` to respectively add numbers to the Span, find out the shortest and longest span between all the numbers stored, and throw exceptions for invalid cases. The class should be tested with a large amount of number (in the 10,000's so they should not be added individualy).
## Exercise 02: Mutated abomination
The exercise requires creating a MutantStack class that offers all member functions of std::stack plus iterators, effectively making std::stack iterable, and writing tests to ensure the new container works as expected.
